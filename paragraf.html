    <body><h1>First Time Go to Lombok</h1>
        <p>One year ago, my family and I prepared to go on holiday to Lombok. <br> We left home at nine oclock a.m., 
            and left home by car It takes 4 hours to get to Ketapang port. On the night trip, it was very quiet, 
            and there were not many vehicles. After arriving at Ketapang port, take a ship to Bali. 
            A short trip from Bali to Padang Bai port, then cross directly by ship. Around 8 am, we arrived at Lombok. 
            I felt very happy even though I was exhausted on the trip. Our destination was Pamenang, stopping for a while to rest and eat together. 
            Next, we headed to Gili Trawangan, which had to be crossed using a Javanese word called “Getek”, the Indonesian term for a small boat. 
            My family and I checked into the hotel and rested.</p>
